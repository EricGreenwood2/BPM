__Getting started__

  * [Install Anaconda with Python 3.x (click to download)](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
  
  * Open Anaconda prompt and change to rotor_noise installation directory
  
  * Create conda environment with required dependencies installed `conda env create -f environment.yml`
  
  * Activate the new conda environment `conda activate broadband`
  
  * Run the example `python ./bpm_noise.py`
  
If you don't have a preferred editor, [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) is free and easy to use. Just open the rotor_noise directory as a project, and configure the project settings to use the environment you created to run the project.  You may also install PyCharm with Anaconda, which includes a copy of Anaconda.
